# sprint_15
Sprint 15 project for TripleTen bootcamp. Neural networks with TensorFlow.

## Usage
The .ipynb file was downloaded as-is from TripleTen's JupyterNotebook instance. The Python code output and Markdown cells should be maintained from when this project was originally reviewed.

Unlike most of the TripleTen projects in my repositories, this will likely not run as-is (or nearly-as-is) on your local. The reason for this is the `datasets/final_files/` folder, which contains over 7500 images--git did not appreciate my attempts to add that much data to the repo on my local, so it's missing from this remote repo. Hopefully the files present still demonstrate my knowledge on the subject matter.
